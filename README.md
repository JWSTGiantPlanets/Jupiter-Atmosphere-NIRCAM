## Contents ##

### [Wind profiles](Wind%20profiles) ###
This folder contains zonal wind profiles in csv format including JWST/NIRCAM wind profiles and references from the literature from Cassini and HST data.

### [Filters penetration depth analysis](Filters%20penetration%20depth%20analysis) ###
This folder contains an analysis of the penetration depth of solar radiation for individual wavelengths. The data is presented in a csv file and is complemented by throughputs of different filters including both JWST/NIRCAM throughtputs and references for other instruments from HST and Cassini.

### [Figures](Figures) ###
High-resolution versions of the figures appearing in the manuscript.

### [NIRCAM Jupiter Images](NIRCAM%20Jupiter%20Images) ###
Derotated images of Jupiter including [Color composites](https://github.com/JWSTGiantPlanets/Jupiter-Atmosphere-NIRCAM/tree/main/NIRCAM%20Jupiter%20Images/Color%20composites). These are intermediate processing results that were used in the wind analysis and are intermediate between the Jupiter Atmosphere raw data from JWST ERS 1373 available at: [http://dx.doi.org/10.17909/vc7n-p631](http://dx.doi.org/10.17909/vc7n-p631).
