F164N Jupiter images obtained from the SUB640 series. These images correspond to the four B detectors on NIRCAM. 

We provide the individual navigated images with WinJupos and maps of these images obtained with a time separation of 10 hr. 
The maps have been processed to show up the cloud features before measuring winds.
