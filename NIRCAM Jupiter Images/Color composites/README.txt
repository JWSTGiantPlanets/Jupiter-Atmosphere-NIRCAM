  Webb NIRCam composite image of Jupiter from four filters: F405N (red), F164N (green), and F335M (blue), plus a luminosity layer from filters F212N and F405N.
  Colors and contrasts were modified for aesthetics. All images were aligned correcting the planet's rotation between the different frames.
